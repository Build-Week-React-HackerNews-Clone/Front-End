### Frontend built using:

#### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is the view layer for web applications.

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

### Other Libraries:

Axios is used to  requests to our backend. Our app, in turn, receives responses from our backend that subsequently renders such data in the related components.




#### Jwt-decode

Used for decoding tokens received from the backend.
